# Haverford_Superlab21
This is some code for the Spring semester of Superlab.
Here, we look at how to analyze the abiotic data you collected during Phase I.
We will review some statistics in class on April 28 and then go over how to conduct these analyses in R.
No R expertise is needed (you're welcome to just listen), but if you'd like to download the code and follow along, you're more than welcome!

This repository contains the following scripts:
- set_up_environment.R: This will allow you to download all the packages you'll need to run the scripts. Run this before attempting to run other R scripts.
- abiotic_stats.R: This is the file we will use to analyze the data in class. It contains several visualizations and statistical analyses.
- plotting.R: This file contains code to plot other variables, in case anyone is interested in seeing the distributions.

It also contains the following data:
- classdata.csv: This file is a cleaned-up version of the data you uploaded to Google Drive.
- classday.csv: This file connects student initials with Superlab sections so that we can see which Duck Pond samples were collected on Monday vs Tuesday.
